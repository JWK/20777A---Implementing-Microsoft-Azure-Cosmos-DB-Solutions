## Lab: Designing and Implementing a Graph Database

### Lab Scenario

You companies online retail system, designed to have thousands of product lines and handle requests from tens of thousands of customers simultaneously, hasn't been achieving the sales targets that the directors expected. The head of sales has asked you to add a 'customers who bought this, also bought this' product recommendation section to the website. 

You have been tasked with:

- Identifying a suitable recommendation engine, and appropriate data structure to store these recommendations in.
- Pre-populating this new recommendation engine with historical purchases.
- Enhancing the existing application to add all the products in a shopping basket to the recommendation engine when a customer successfully checks out.
- Enhancing the existing application to add a recommendations section to the product details page.

### Objectives

At the end of this lab, you should be able to:

1. Create a graph database on Cosmos DB.
2. Bulk load data into a graph database.
3. Implement a recommendations engine using Gremlin.NET.
4. Enhance existing web pages with product recommendations.

### Lab Setup

-  **Estimated time**: 60 minutes
-  **Virtual machine**: 20777A-LON-DEV
-  **User name**: LON-DEV\\Administrator
-  **Password**: Pa55w.rd

### Exercise 1: Implementing a recommendations engine for customers

#### Exercise 1 Scenario

The Adventure-Works app (that you created in the lab for Module 3), needs to be enhanced with a recommendations engine. After researching your options you have decided to implement a graph database to store and make the recommendations. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Prepare the environment, and test the Adventure-Works online application. 
2.  Create a graph database, and enable the application to connect to it. 
3.  Upload a JSON file that contains purchase history.
4.  Write some test traversals to prove the data loaded successfully.

#### Prepare the Environment

Using **File Explorer**:

1. In **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter**, right-click **cosmos-setup.ps1.txt**, and then click **Edit**.
2. In Notepad, edit **20777a-mod5-sql-&lt;your initials and day&gt;** and change the  **&lt;your initials and day&gt;** to your initials and a number between 1 and 31, for example **20777a-mod5-sql-pjs14**.
3. Edit **20777blobmod5&lt;your initials and day&gt;** and change the **&lt;your initials and day&gt;** to your initials and a number between 1 and 31, for example, **20777blobmod5pjs14**.
4. On line 19, change the **resourceGroupLocation** variable to the name of your closest Azure location.
5. On the **File** menu, click click **Save**.
6. Close Notepad.
7. Using File Explorer, in **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter**, run **Setup.cmd** as Administrator.
8. Enter your Azure credentials when prompted. Note that this script can take some time to complete.

Using the **Azure portal**:

1. Make a note of the end point uri and primary key for the created SQL Cosmos DB account.
2. Make a note of the connection string for the created Blob storage account.

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Open the the **MigrateProductData** solution in **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter\\MigrateProductData**.
2. In Solution Explorer, double-click **App.config**.
3. Edit **enter Blob storage connection string** and change to the connection string you copied in the previous section.
4. Press F5 to build and run the application. 
5. In the console window, once completed, press Enter.
6. Open the the **Adventure-Works** solution in **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter\\Adventure-Works**.
7. Edit the **Web.config** file, setting the **EndpointUrl** and **PrimaryKey** settings to the values you recorded for the Cosmos DB account.
8. Press F5 to build and run the application. 
9. Click **Search By Category**, and then click **Details** against a product.
10. Check that the images load and product details are shown.
11. Stop the program.

#### Task 1: Create a graph database

Using the **Azure portal**:

1. Create a **Cosmos DB** account named **20777a-mod5-graph-&lt;your initials and a day&gt;** using a **Gremlin (graph)** API. 
2. Use the existing resource group and select the region closest to you.
3. Once the account is created, configure the database firewall to enable clients to access databases, and use the **Data Explorer** to create a new database named **Adventure-Works**.
4. Then add a new graph named **recommendations**, using the fixed storage capacity option, and a throughput of **2500** RU/s.
5. Make a note of the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING**, deleting **ApiKind=Gremlin;** and adding **Database=Adventure-Works;** from the string to use in the data migration tool.

#### Task 2: Upload a JSON file that contents purchase history

Use the **Data Migration Tool** to upload historical data:

1. Run the GUI version of the Data Migration tool **E:\\dmt\\bin\\dtui\\dtui.exe**.
2. Select JSON as the source, and use the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Data\\purchase-history.json** file. 
3. For the target, select **DocumentDB - Sequential record import (partitioned collections)** and use the connection string copied previously.
4. Use **recommendations** for the collection, and **id** as the Id Field.
5. **98** records should be imported.

#### Task 3: Write some test traversals to prove the data loaded

Using the **Azure portal**:

1. Using the **Data Explorer**, run the `g.V()` command.
2. Navigate the graph and note that the edges go from and to each node. 
3. Execute `g.V("795").out().out().dedup().values('id')` and note the list of product ids.

**Question**: Can you rewrite the Gremlin query so that the number of out() steps can be configured in the next exercise? Test your new query in the Azure portal.

> **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have completed the setup of the Adventure-Works online application. You will have created a new graph database to store details of products that are purchased at the same time, and loaded the new graph with a number of historical purchases.

### Exercise 2: Recording product purchase information

#### Exercise 2 Scenario

The Adventure-Works app, needs to be enhanced to connect to the newly created graph database and store all the products in a customers shopping basket when they checkout. The application will need to check that the products don't already exist in the graph, and that all the products in the shopping cart create edges to connect the products together. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Add the connection strings to the graph database to the Adventure works solution. 
2.  Create a **Recommendations** class to handle the connection to the graph database and add a method to load data into it. 
3.  Enable the application to add the products, and the edges connecting them, to the graph when a customer checks out.
4.  Test the data is being added to the graph correctly before continuing to the next exercise.

#### Task 1: Add connection strings

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Open the **Adventure-Works** solution in **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter\\Adventure-Works**.
2. In **Web.config** add settings to store the Gremlin endpoint and primary key.
3. In **Recommendations.cs** examine the existing code.
4. Note it's use of the Gremlin.Net.Driver library and check that the AppSettings it is expecting in the Initialize method matches the settings you added to the **Web.config**.
5. Using the Azure portal, copy the Gremlin endpoint and key into the **Web.config**.

#### Task 2: Create a Recommendations class

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Find an appropriate place to call the **Initialize** method when the application starts, a good place may be where the other connections to the Cosmos DB are currently being initialized.
2. Finish writing the **AddProductRelationships** method, start by building a Gremlin query that checks if the product already exists in the graph.

    ```
    g.V().has('product', 'id', '{p.ProductID}')
       .fold()
       .coalesce(
            unfold(),
            addV('product').property('id', '{p.ProductID}')
        ).property('name','{p.ProductName}')"
    ```
3. Then for all the other products in the basket, add an edge to the current product.

    ```
    .addE('bought').property('customerID','{basket.CustomerID}')
        .to(g.V().has('product', 'id', '{link.ProductID}')
            .fold()
            .coalesce(unfold(),addV('product').property('id', '{link.ProductID}')).property('name','{link.ProductName}')).outV()
    ```
4. Once the Gremlin query string has been built submit the query to the graph database. 

#### Task 3: Add products on checkout

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. The MVC nature of the online application means that the controlling logic is stored in a controller for each model. 
2. Examine the code in the **ShoppingCartController**, noting all the different methods provided.
3. Edit the **PlaceOrderAsync** method, and add a call to the finished **AddProductRelationships** method in our **Recommendations** class just before the shopping cart is removed from the session.

#### Task 4: Test the new functionality

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Compile the application and resolve any compilation errors. 
2. Run the application and place some orders, debug your code and check that calls are being made to the updated recommendations class. 

Using the Azure portal:

1. Using the **Data Explorer**, write some Gremlin queries to check that all the products in your shopping basket have been added to the graph. 
2. Check all the edges have been created to connect all the products together.

**Question**: What happens to the recommendations if the customer decides to delete items in the shopping basket before completing the order?

> **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have a new Recommendations class that can connect the graph you setup in the first exercise. The application should be correctly saving all the products in a shopping cart when a customer places an order.


### Exercise 3: Querying a graph database to obtain recommendations

#### Exercise 3 Scenario

The Adventure-Works app is now adding products and edges to a recommendations graph. The application now needs to be able to query the graph and return a randomized list of recommendations. The sales team has specified that a maximum of 5 products should be shown to start with, but they would like the ability to change this in the future if performance of the website isn't affected. The marketing team would like the recommendations to be randomized, to maximize the number of products a customer will be shown in any given visit to the website.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Write a Gremlin query to return a list of product ids to recommend to customers. 
2.  Randomize these recommendations so that customers see different products each time they visit the site. 
3.  Build a list of Products to be stored in the product model and used in the product details view.

#### Task 1: Write a Gremlin query

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Build a Gremlin query to return a list of linked products, use the query in the preparation steps as a starting point. 

    ```
    g.V('[product that needs recommendations]').as('bought')
        .repeat(out()).times(3)
        .where(neq('bought')).dedup().values('id')
    ```
2. The query should have an adjustable depth, as in the future this may need to be changed. 
3. To execute your Gremlin query, add this code into the **GetReccomendationsAsync** method:

    ```Csharp
        string query = $"g.V('{recProductID}').as('bought').repeat(out()).times({depth}).where(neq('bought')).dedup().values('id')";

        var response = await gClient.SubmitAsync<object>(query);
    ```
4. The **GetReccomendationsAsync** method should be able to return a configurable number of products. As this may also need to be changed in he future. 

#### Task 2: Randomize the recommendations

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Use this code to cast the results to an array:

    ```Csharp
    string[] productIDs = response.Cast<string>().ToArray(); 
    ```
    
2. With the array of products, use the helper methods to randomize the list.
3. Loop through the array, ensuring that only the required number of Product objects are created.

#### Task 3: Build a list of Products

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Using the existing Repository class, get a document for each id in the array of recommendations.
2. For an example of how to query the document database, see the **ProductsController** class. 
3. Add the returned products to a list.
4. Return the list to the calling method to be displayed on the product page.

### Exercise 4: Add a recommendation section to the product page

#### Exercise 4 Scenario

The marketing and sale teams have decided the best place to show customers recommendations is on the product details page under the **Add to Shopping Cart** button. With the application able to return a list of products to be shown, enhance the current MVC application to display thumbnails, product names and a link to click to get more information about a recommendation.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Add a recommendations property to the Product model.
2.  Enhance the ProductsController class to store the recommendations with the product.
3.  Update the product details view to display the recommended products.
4.  Test the application now displays recommended products. 

#### Task 1: Update the Product model

Using **Visual Studio 2017**:

1. Look at the code contained in the **Product** class. It contains all the properties that are stored in the document database. 
2. In the Product document, add a property to hold a list of Products called Recommendations. This list will be iterated through in the product details view. 
3. The property should be a take the form of a list of products, for example **List<Product>**.

#### Task 2: Enhance the ProductsController class

1. Find the method that is used to build the model that is displayed by the **GetProductDetails** view.
2. Add a call to the method, passing the product id you want to get recommendations for. Store the results of that call to the updated product model. 
3. Add the returned list of products to the Recommendations property of the product that is going to be displayed. 

#### Task 3: Update the GetProductDetails view

1. Add the following code underneath the **div** that displays the **Add to Shopping Cart** button.

    ```HTML
    @if (Model.Recommendations.Count() > 0)
    {
        <hr />
        <h3>You might also like</h3>
        foreach (var item in Model.Recommendations)
        {
            <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:row; padding:5px">
                <div style="order:0; padding-right:5px">
                    <a href="@Url.Action("GetProductDetails", "Products", new { ProductID = item.ProductID })" title="Click for more details">
                        <img src='@item.Images.Thumbnail' />
                    </a>
                </div>
                <div style="order:1; padding-right:15px; align-self:center">
                    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.ProductName)
                </div>
            </div>
        }
    }
    ```

2. A **foreach** loop is then used to loop through all the products and display its thumbnail, retrieved from the Blob storage, and the products name. 

**Question**: What is the difference between a shopping cart and an order?

#### Task 4: Test the application

1. Compile the application and resolve any compilation errors. 
2. Add some products to your basket, noting any that have recommendations. 
3. Complete a check out, and repeat step 2.
4. Test that the recommendations are randomized by refreshing the products detail page. 
5. Check with the Azure portal that products are being added to the graph correctly.  

#### Task 5: Lab Close Down

To reduce your costs delete the resource group containing your Cosmos DB databases:

1.  In Internet Explorer, in the Azure Portal, click **Resource groups**.

2.  Right-click **20777\_Mod05**, and then click **Delete resource group**.

3.  On the **Are you sure you want to delete "20777\_Mod05"?** blade, in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:** box, type **20777\_Mod05**, and then click **Delete**.

4.  When you have finished, close Internet Explorer.

**Question**: Can you think of another place that displaying recommendations may improve sales?

**Question**: How easy would it be to implement?
