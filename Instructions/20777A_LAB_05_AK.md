5. Replace **g.V()** with **g.V("795").out().dedup().values('id')**, and then click **Execute Gremlin Query**. Note that the JSON returned is a list of product ids from customers who also bought product 795.
6. Extend the query to find all products that were bought by customers who also bought one or more products from the previous list:

    ```gremlin
    g.V("795").out().out().dedup().values('id')
    ```

**Question**: Can you rewrite the Gremlin query so that the number of out() steps can be configured in the next exercise? Test your new query in the Azure portal.

**Answer**: Gremlin has a repeat() step. Using this, you can write the query as:

```gremlin
g.V("795").repeat(out()).times(2).dedup().values('id')
```

Using `times(2)` enables the 2 to be replaced by a variable.

**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have completed the setup of the Adventure-Works online application. You will have created a new graph database to store details of products that are purchased at the same time, and loaded the new graph with a number of historical purchases.

### Exercise 2: Recording product purchase information

#### Task 1: Add connection strings

- In Visual Studio 2017, on the **Web.config** tab, under the code:

    ```XML
    <add key="PrimaryKey" value="..." />
    ```

    Type the following code:

    ```XML
    <add key="GremlinEndpoint" value="20777a-mod5-graph-<your initials and a day>.gremlin.cosmosdb.azure.com" />
    <add key="GremlinKey" value="<graph database primary key>" />
    ```

    Replace **20777a-mod5-graph-\<your initials and a day\>** and **\<graph database primary key\>** with the values you recorded in the previous exercise.

#### Task 2: Create a Recommendations class

1. In Solution Explorer, click **Global.asax**.
2. On the **Global.asax** tab, under the **// TODO: Connect to the recommendation engine** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    Recommendations.Initialize();
    ```

3. In Solution Explorer, click **Recommendations.cs**.
4. On the **Recommendations.cs** tab, in the **AddProductRelationships** method, under the **// TODO: gremlin upsert command - check if the vertices exists, if not add it** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    query = $"g.V().has('product', 'id', '{p.ProductID}').fold().coalesce(unfold(),addV('product').property('id', '{p.ProductID}').property('partkey', 'p')).property('name','{p.ProductName}')";
    ```

5. Under the **// TODO: Need to loop through all other items in the basket to add edges** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    foreach (OrderItem link in basket.OrderItems)
    {
        if (p.ProductID != link.ProductID)
        {
            // Customers who bought this also bought this
            query += $".addE('bought').property('customerID','{basket.CustomerID}').to(g.V().has('product', 'id', '{link.ProductID}').fold().coalesce(unfold(),addV('product').property('id', '{link.ProductID}').property('partkey', 'p')).property('name','{link.ProductName}')).outV()";
        }
    }
    ```

#### Task 3: Add products on checkout

1. In Solution Explorer, expand **Controllers**, and then click **ShoppingCartController.cs**.
2. On the **ShoppingCartController.cs** tab, in the **PlaceOrderAsync()** method, under the **// TODO: Add recommendations to the graph engine** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    await Recommendations.AddProductRelationships(shoppingCart);
    ```

#### Task 4: Test the new functionality

1. Press F5 to build and run the application.
2. In Internet Explorer, click **Search by Category**, and then next to a product, click the **Details** link.
3. Click **Add to Shopping Cart**.
4. In the **Customer ID** box, type **12**, and then click **Login**.
5. In the **Message from webpage** dialog box, click **OK**.
6. At the top of the page, click **Adventure-Works Product Catalog**.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 to add at least 3 products to your shopping cart.
8. On the **Shopping Cart** page, click **Place Order**.
9. In the **Message from webpage** dialog box, click **OK**.
10. On the **Orders** page, in the order you just placed, click **Details**.
11. On the **Order Details** page, make a note of the **Product ID** number for one of the products.
12. In the Azure portal, in the **GREMLIN API** pane, expand **Adventure-Works**, expand **recommendations**, and then click **Graph**.
13. On the **Graph** tab, replace **g.V()** with **g.V("product id")** replacing **product id** with a **Product ID** number that was in your order, and then click **Execute Gremlin Query**.
14. In Visual Studio 2017, on the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.

**Question**: What happens to the recommendations if the customer decides to delete items in the shopping basket before completing the order?

**Answer**: The code to add products to the recommendations graph is only executed when the user clicks the place order button. So removing products form the shopping cart has no effect.

**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have a new Recommendations class that can connect the graph you setup in the first exercise. The application should be saving all the products in a shopping cart when a customer places an order.

### Exercise 3: Querying a graph database to obtain recommendations

#### Task 1: Write a Gremlin query

1. In Visual Studio 2017, on the **Recommendations.cs** tab, in the **GetReccomendationsAsync** task, under the **// TODO: Ask Gremlin to go get the list of product ids to recommend (default to a depth of 3)** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    string query = $"g.V('{recProductID}').as('bought').repeat(out()).times({depth}).where(neq('bought')).dedup().values('id')";

    var response = await gClient.SubmitAsync<object>(query);
    ```

2. Under the **// TODO: If there are recommendations, randomize them and return the required number** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    if (response.Count > 0)
    { 
        // Need to randomize a collection of objects

        // Loop through the recommended randomized product ids

    }
    ```

#### Task 2: Randomize the recommendations

1. Under the **// Need to randomize a collection of objects** comment, type the following code to cast the query results as an array:

    ```Csharp
    string[] productIDs = response.Cast<string>().ToArray(); // Cast Gremlin results as an array of strings
    ```

2. Type the following code to randomize the list:

    ```Csharp
    Shuffle(productIDs);
    ```

#### Task 3: Build a list of Products

- Under the **// Loop through the recommended randomized product ids** comment, type the following code to get a document for each id in the array of recommendations:

    ```Csharp
    for (int i=0; i < numberReccomendations && i < productIDs.Count(); i++)
    {
        // Go get the full product document from Cosmos DB
        var products = await Repository<Product>.GetItemsAsync(p => p.ProductID == productIDs[i]);
        results.Add(products.FirstOrDefault());
    }
    ```

### Exercise 4: Add a recommendation section to the product page

#### Task 1: Update the Product model

1. In Solution Explorer, expand **Models**, and then click **Products.cs**.
2. On the **Products.cs** tab, look at the code contained in the **Product** class. It contains all the properties that are stored in the document database.
3. In the **Product** class, under the **//TODO: Add a list of recommended products** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    [JsonProperty("recommendations")]
    public List<Product> Recommendations { get; set; }
    ```

#### Task 2: Enhance the ProductsController class

1. In Solution Explorer, expand **Controllers**, and then click **ProductsController.cs**.
2. on the **ProductsController.cs** tab, in the **GetProductDetailsAsync** task, under the **// TODO: Go get the products to recommend** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    var recommendedProducts = await Recommendations.GetReccomendationsAsync(productID);
    ```

3. Under the **// TODO: Add recommendations to the product model** comment, type the following code:

    ```Csharp
    products.First().Recommendations = recommendedProducts;
    ```

#### Task 3: Update the GetProductDetails view

1. In Solution Explorer, expand **Views**, expand **Products**, and then click **GetProductDetails.cshtml**.
2. On the **GetProductDetails.cshtml** tab, under the **\<!-- TODO: Recommendations need to be added here --\>** comment, type the following code:

    ```HTML
    @if (Model.Recommendations.Count() > 0)
    {
        <hr />
        <h3>You might also like</h3>
        foreach (var item in Model.Recommendations)
        {
            <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:row; padding:5px">
                <div style="order:0; padding-right:5px">
                    <a href="@Url.Action("GetProductDetails", "Products", new { ProductID = item.ProductID })" title="Click for more details">
                        <img src='@item.Images.Thumbnail' />
                    </a>
                </div>
                <div style="order:1; padding-right:15px; align-self:center">
                    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.ProductName)
                </div>
            </div>
        }
    }
    ```

**Question**: What is the difference between a shopping cart and an order?

**Answer**: Shopping carts contain order items, on check out. 

#### Task 4: Test the application

1. Press F5 to build and run the application. 
2. In Internet Explorer, on the **Product Catalog** page, click **Search By Category**.
3. Next to a product, click the **Details** link.

15. Check using the Azure portal that products are being added to the graph correctly.
16. In Visual Studio 2017, on the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.
17. Close Visual Studio 2017.

**Question**: Can you think of another place that displaying recommendations may improve sales?

**Answer**: The Shopping Cart page, under Place Order. It gives the customers a chance to navigate to other products before placing an order. 

**Question**: How easy would it be to implement?

**Answer**: A list of recommended products would need to be added to the shopping cart model, and the view changed to display them. In the solutions folder, there is a Complete-Solution that shows this implementation. 

#### Task 5: Lab Close Down
